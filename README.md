# Accessibility plug-in for Unity Games

This plug in was developped during a three months placement. Work may be continued in the future, as I am currently working on a personal project involving Unity.
You can use/extend this project as much as you want. Some features can be very easily integrated in existing unity games (like post effect shaders)
